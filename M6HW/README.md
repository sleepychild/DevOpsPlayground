# HOMEWORK M6

##Assignment

> 1) With the help of the tools studied so far, try to create an environment like the one used during the third part
(one Nagios host and one Docker host with NRPE installed) of the module, but do it in an automated fashion
and try to avoid any manual tasks to the extent possible



> 2) Download and experiment with Icinga. Try to create similar environment (as in whichever part you choose
from the practice) and repeat some of the activities
